The goal of this project is to "practice" Python 3.
The assignments are assgined by Dr. Chuck @ https://www.py4e.com/

File naming:
--------------
In terms of naming the files I tried to:
- use leading 0 to ensure my files stay lined up in an easy-to-hard order
- keep all files in the same path to reduce the number of clicks.
- keep the file names short, but meaningful.
- use "_" to delimit words, not spaces.
