Four P words, four C words for your possible courses in life:

Passion: your interest, what you decided  to do. You have to be passionate
about your course interests in what you explore. As part of passion, you can't
just be  passionate and expect to succeed in life. You need a purpose.

Purpose: you need a goal. You need to be moving toward something.
Maybe this course you took wasn't your highest goal. But it was a goal, nonetheless.

Persistence, or grit. You push your way through it. Persevere in that class.
Find that extra energy inside. And I want to congratulate all of you for
finding that.
That's the number one word today in  psychology.

Playfulness: you have to have a little bit of playfulness along the way.

Chose: It's your personal decision to get into this class and complete that class
Commitment: you committed to it to completing this course.
Connections. It is about about connections and relationships. You form new
bridges, new relationships, new possible pathways, possible courses in your life.
And so those connections you have might help you down the road anywhere.
Not just for the content here, but maybe they'll help you get an new job
somewhere, or find out about a new interest,

Completion:
You complete a course, you might get a certificate.

If you can keep those eight principles in mind as you proceed into other courses,
I think maybe you'll find some future successes.
