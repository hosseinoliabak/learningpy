Application Program Interface (API)
The API itself is largely abstract in that it specifies an interface and
controls the behavior of the objects specified in that interface. The software
that provides the functionality described by an API is said to be an
"implementation" of the API.  An API is typically defined in terms of the
programming language used to build an application.
